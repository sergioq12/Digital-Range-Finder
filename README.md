# Digital Golf Range Finder

`**Note:** Code was created in 2022, but was held privately until now. `

Welcome all to my attempt to create a golf range finder from an image! My name is Sergio Quijano and I was a D1 Golf Athlete. Funny enough my freshmen year of college I came to the US in order to play and compete golf at Mount St. Mary's University. However, with some bad luck I had to play my first year of college golf without a range finder (not that its required, but its helpful tool). In that moment, I was just starting my Computer Science major and had zero coding experience. Nonetheless, a couple years later (now with range finder!), during the end of my junior year, I decided that I had the skillset to try and attempt creating a program that perhaps can come close to what a range finder can do with taking pictures in your phone. Therefore, it lead me to the path of creating this project. Spoiler... there is a reason you need to buy a Golf Range Finder or use a GPS Golf app to track distances. However, the process was very fun and if anyone is curious enough can look at the code and see what I did. 

**Note:** I will not share publicly the data (images) I used for training my models. However, after data augmentation processes I can say that it was in the ballpark of around 20,000 - 30,000 images.
